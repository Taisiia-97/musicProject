# Music Application

## Description

This application serves as a music database designed to keep track listings of selected records. 
To initiate the database, we've included details for a single album, "Vows" by Kimbra, which was released in 2011. 
However, it's important to note that the album comes in two editions: a shorter version containing 11 songs (the original Australian / New Zealand release), 
and a longer version containing 13 songs (the North American / European release). 
The purpose of this application is to provide a platform for managing and accessing track listings for various albums. 
While the initial focus is on "Vows" by Kimbra, the architecture allows for scalability and the addition of more albums in the future.
